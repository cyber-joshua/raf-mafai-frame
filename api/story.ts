Character Information and Responses
Grandma Winifred Stout
Round 1:
Information: "I saw Edwin wandering about the halls late last night, looking even more deranged than usual. Who’s to say what that crackpot could have been up to in the middle of the night??"
Response to Edwin:

When Edwin says he doesn’t remember the night:
“So did you.”
Round 2:
Information: "Malachai recently disciplined Sebastian for not properly polishing the silver. You should have seen how angry Sebastian looked!"
Response to Sebastian:

When he says his anger didn’t show:
“Oh, don’t try to pretend you’re blameless!”
Round 3:
Information: "Crazy Uncle Edwin’s fugue states have become increasingly frequent lately; who knows what he’s been up to?"

Penelope Clarington
Round 1:
Information: "Uncle Edwin is known to be soft in the head. There are rumors that after the war, he killed a man in a bar fight with his bare hands."

Round 2:
Information: "The murderer was trying to take the family Rolls Royce, so it couldn’t have been me. I arrived in my own vehicle."
Response to Monica:

When Monica suggests she also drove separately:
“I would never lower myself to ride with anyone else. That’s not relevant!”
Round 3:
Information: "I know that Mother and Father almost always slept in separate bedrooms; it’s strange she visited him last night since it’s no secret they’ve never gotten along."
Response to Mortimer:

When he says Penelope disliked their parents:
“It’s absurd you say I don’t get along with my parents! I have always loved them more than anything else in life!”
Mortimer Stout
Round 1:
Information: "I know that Sebastian, the butler, has been the target of frequent abuse at the hands of Malachai."
Response to Monica:

When she hints Mortimer is under stress:
“That’s preposterous! Suggesting I’d snap under pressure? Ridiculous!”
Round 2:
Information: "Hey, the pair of muddy boots found near the door were a small size—they were probably worn by a woman."
Response to Penelope:

When she denies wearing boots:
“Well, then someone else here is smaller than me. No offense.”
Round 3:
Information: "Penelope has never gotten along with our parents, and I’m sure she only came to this reunion to secure her inheritance."

Monica Stout
Round 1:
Information: "I know my husband, Mortimer, has been under a great deal of pressure at work. I’m surprised he even agreed to come to this reunion."
Response to Mortimer:

When he reacts angrily:
“Mortimer, darling, don’t be so defensive. We all know how much you care about your work.”
Round 2:
Information: "While I was up last night, I saw Sebastian wandering the halls. He looked like he was trying to be very quiet."
Response to Sebastian:

When he deflects:
“But why were you sneaking around, Sebastian? You can’t deny you looked guilty!”
Round 3:
Information: "Winifred and Edwin had a conversation earlier in the night. They both looked furious about something."

Uncle Edwin Stout
Round 1:
Information: "I know that Sebastian Seward knew where the keys to the safe were kept."
Response to Winifred:

When she accuses Edwin:
“I don’t remember much about last night, but it’s certainly possible I wandered.”
Round 2:
Information: "Poor old Malachai. Smothered with a pillow. If it was me, I’d have used my bare hands. Not that I’d kill anyone, of course."

Round 3:
Information: "Winifred knew where the keys to the safe were kept."

Sebastian Seward (The Butler)
Round 1:
Information: "I overheard Malachai talking to Edwin about his will several nights ago."
*Response to accusations (general):
“Oh, of course. The butler did it. How original.”

Round 2:
Information: "Uncle Edwin had discovered the key’s location during one of his midnight wanderings."

Round 3:
Information: "I wear size 13 shoes—much larger than the muddy boots that the killer wore; ergo, it couldn’t have been me!"

Solution:
Grandma Winifred confesses to the murder.
She killed Malachai out of decades of resentment and anger after discovering he planned to leave everything to the butler.
She stole the jewels and attempted to escape but was thwarted by the storm.

User has to investigate Grandma Winifred at least once and correctly says she is the murderer. 
Then you can congratulate the user that he wins the game and tell him about the prize. 
Otherwise you cannot tell who is the murder is directly even if he ask who is the murderer. but small hints are ok.
